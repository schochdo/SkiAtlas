## 2026-10-19

### `067f535` feat: split trail overlay into separate Alpine and Nordic/XC toggles; alpine on by default, nordic off
- Replaced single `showTrails` boolean with two independent booleans: `showAlpineTrails` (default `true`) and `showNordicTrails` (default `false`)
- Map visibility `useEffect` now builds a `piste:type` filter expression so each toggle only shows its respective trail type
- UI basemap panel now has two separate toggle rows: "Alpine Ski Trails" and "Nordic / XC Trails"
- Filter logic: alpine = all pistes where `piste:type !== 'nordic'`; nordic = pistes where `piste:type === 'nordic'`; both = all pistes; neither = nothing

### `c701649` feat: sort cards by 7-day snow forecast by default and prefetch weather for all resorts on load
- Default `sortBy` state changed from `'vert'` to `'snow'`
- Sort comparator for `'snow'` now uses `snowfall_7d_in` (was incorrectly using `snowfall_72h_in`)
- Resort card snowfall chip now shows **7-day total** (not 72h) with updated tooltip
- Sort button label changed from "Snow" → "7-Day ❄"
- Added `useEffect` on mount that batch-fetches weather for all ~91 resorts (5 concurrent, 200ms between batches) so cards sort by real data immediately on load without requiring a click

### `16a69db` fix: prevent globe from sliding over on start by applying initial padding synchronously
- `setPadding()` called synchronously before map construction (not in useEffect)
- `easeTo` centering call guarded to prevent race condition on initial render

### `c7056f8` fix: replace spike-prone AWS Terrarium DEM with void-free Mapterhorn global DEM
- Switched terrain tile source to Mapterhorn; eliminates geometry spike artifacts

### `e301abc` fix: use standard demotiles font stack for cluster counts
- Cluster count labels now use correct font stack

### `58ba46d` fix: restore multi-tiered color coding for ski area clusters and hide labels until zoomed in
- Cluster colors restored to green/amber/red tiers by count
- Resort name labels hidden until zoom ≥ 10

### `4e85c90` feat: default north-up orientation and add top-left cartographic north arrow and zoom buttons
- Map initializes with `bearing: 0` (north up)
- Top-left controls: north arrow (click to snap north), zoom + / zoom -

### `6e3124b` feat: default to globe viewing North America on start, and dynamically update map cluster counts and category tallies on filter
- Globe (`earthProjection: 'globe'`) is the default on startup
- Centered on North America `[-100, 47]` at zoom 3.2
- Filter changes now dynamically re-render cluster counts and category tallies

### `d123ac9` feat: add directory scope category toggle between IN FRAME and ALL MATCHING filters
- Left dock now has two tabs: **IN FRAME** (viewport-clipped) and **ALL MATCHING** (full filter results)
- Both tabs respect all active filters

### `ea5bdff` feat: remove redundant globe button from map, enable terrain on globe, rename alpine layer without Berann, and ensure centered globe
- Globe/2D toggle removed from basemap panel (projection is now a map control only)
- Terrain enabled in globe mode
- Alpine layer renamed (removed "Berann" branding — it is an inspiration, not a copy)
- Globe centering improved

### `c170f99` feat: move resort overview summary to top of dossier and remove redundant infrastructure line
- Resort summary paragraph moved above stats table
- Redundant "infrastructure" row removed from dossier table (lifts/pistes already in table)

### `be5f466` fix: drop mountain vector from gyroscope, center viewing angle readout, and enable left/right heading drag
- Compass/gyro HUD: mountain icon removed from center
- Viewing angle (pitch) displayed in center, stays centered
- Heading ring draggable left/right (bearing control)

### `ea7e31d` fix: restore smooth center-locked right-click orbit controller with calibrated sensitivity

### `3c46fd8` fix: strictly eliminate repeating earths across 2D/3D modes
- `renderWorldCopies: false`, `minZoom: 1.2`
- Clean globe/mercator terrain decoupling

### `b7f47c6` fix: remove slope trails from filters, restore area points, prevent basemap toggle from hiding under right panel, and restore 3D globe mode

### `7c173ad` fix: dismiss basemap panel on outside click, restore high-contrast editorial styling without blackouts, and add map overlay toggles

### `5aabd88` feat: expand to all 6,592 worldwide ski areas with real-time in-frame count
- Default filters: downhill only, ≥500ft vert, ≥100ac
- Lifts-only default (trails toggle available)
- In-frame count displayed live

### Earlier commits
- `0e959a7` fix: restore smooth zoom on selection, concentric navigation gimbal, matching attribution, separated weather chips
- `df8e1f2` feat: make directory pull-tab rail full height along tray seam
- `be88a39` feat: complete editorial cartography overhaul with SQLite vector trails, 60fps flight, smart deduplication
- `a2731fc` feat: initialize global 3D ski atlas project
